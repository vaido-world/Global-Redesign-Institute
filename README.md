# Global-Redesign-Institute
Designing out of current social structure.

Are you tired of Git, Linux, GNU, Chrome, Firefox, Windows, Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba and everyone else, well I am.

## Some silly idea about a website.
> A real time wikipedia for software development.
You can see when someone is writing something.
You can see when a document is created.
Everything is animated. You can hop in and contribute.
A social experience, a social programming, social development.
Social redesign institute. Everything is public domain by default.
