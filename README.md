# Global-Redesign-Institute
Designing out of current social structure.

Are you tired of Git, Linux, GNU, Chrome, Firefox, Windows, Apple, Lenovo, Toshiba and everyone else, well I am.

## Some silly idea about a website.
> A real time wikipedia for software development.
You can see when someone is writing something.
You can see when a document is created.
Everything is animated. You can hop in and contribute.
A social experience, a social programming, social development.
Social redesign institute. Everything is public domain by default.
1. Step make some kind of prototype where everyone can edit everything on a website and it is synced.
2. What happens when multiple users try to edit the same document?
3. Source control and version control
4. How would you determine what is quality content and the document is not being broken maliciously?
5. Reputation and point system? Allowed Reference points list?
6. Allowed systemic words list?
7. Syntax checker for systemic english sentences?
8. Thematic border zones, keywords checks? Scienctific field keywords checks?
9. What about bitmap, images and graphics?
10. Advanced recognition system with moderation?
